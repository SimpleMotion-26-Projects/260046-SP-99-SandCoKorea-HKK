## HKK Project - Clarification Needed

The "HKK" in the project name requires clarification. Possible interpretations:
- **Harry Potter Korea** - There are references to Harry Potter Korea in early 2022 emails
- **Other Korean show** - Could be another theatrical production

**Note:** Email search did not return specific results for "HKK" as a show name. Recommend confirming with the client or internal team what "HKK" refers to.
