Dear John and Ji,

Thank you for the additional information regarding the line pull (230 lbf) and deck height (152mm). We have now reviewed the bid documents and production schedule in detail.

We have a few clarifying questions to ensure our quotation is accurate:

**Track Travel Distances:**
1. What are the travel distances for each of the 8 effects? The ground plan shows the track positions but we want to confirm the actual travel required for each unit.
2. For the full-stage tracks (#1 and #6), what is the total travel from offstage storage to onstage position?

**Equipment Scope:**
3. The US tour specs mention the show deck must be setup and rigged at shop with load testing. Will S&Co Korea fabricate the deck tracks locally, or are you looking for SimpleMotion to supply complete track systems?
4. For the overhead sliders (Effects #7 and #8), will these be integrated into existing venue infrastructure or do you need complete overhead track systems?

**Control System:**
5. The specs reference feet/inches programming. You mentioned preferring metres - we can accommodate this. Do you also prefer Korean language interface on the control system?
6. How many operator positions are required at GS Arts Center?

**Venue & Installation:**
7. What is the grid height and available rigging positions at GS Arts Center?
8. Will SimpleMotion need to provide technicians for the full load-in period (July 1-12) or specific days only?

**Commercial:**
9. Are you looking for equipment rental for the 126-performance season, or purchase of the automation system?
10. Will there be option periods or potential tour extension beyond November 8?

We would welcome a Zoom call to discuss these items. We are available:
- **Wednesday Feb 5, 3-5 PM Korea time**
- **Thursday Feb 6, 3-5 PM Korea time**

Please let us know what works best.

We are excited about the opportunity to support Hell's Kitchen Korea and continue our partnership with S&Co.

Kind Regards,
