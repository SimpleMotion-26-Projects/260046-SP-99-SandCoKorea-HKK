Dear John and Ji,

Thank you for the additional information regarding the line pull (230 lbf) and deck height (152mm). We have now reviewed the bid documents and production schedule in detail.

We have a few clarifying questions to ensure our quotation is accurate:

**Equipment Scope:**

We propose to provide a drop-in floor tracking system for the following axes:

| Axis | Effect | Type | Length | Speed (ft/s) | Speed (mm/s) |
|------|--------|------|-------:|------:|-------------:|
| 1 | #1 Track - Full Stage | Full Stage | 21500 mm | 4.0 ft/s | 1220 mm/s |
| 2 | #1 SR - Half Stage Track | Half Stage | 10500 mm | 4.0 ft/s | 1220 mm/s |
| 3 | #1 SL - Half Stage Track | Half Stage | 10500 mm | 4.0 ft/s | 1220 mm/s |
| 4 | #2 SR - Half Stage Track | Half Stage | 10500 mm | 4.0 ft/s | 1220 mm/s |
| 5 | #2 SL - Half Stage Track | Half Stage | 10500 mm | 4.0 ft/s | 1220 mm/s |
| 6 | IN-3 Balcony - Full Stage Track | Full Stage | 21500 mm | 4.0 ft/s | 1220 mm/s |
| 7 | IN-2 SL Slider | Overhead | 8000 mm | 4.5 ft/s | 1370 mm/s |
| 8 | IN-2 SR Slider | Overhead | 8000 mm | 4.5 ft/s | 1370 mm/s |

- We have suitable floor winches and control that will be available in South Korea at this time.
- This will reduce any freight costs and shipping time.
- With the show deck height set at 6 inches (152mm), this does not allow the hoists to be set into the show deck.
- Is there the possibility of having the show deck at 10 inches (250mm)?

**Venue & Installation:**

We propose to send one senior automation technician for the load-in (July 1-12), tech (July 14-26), and preview periods (July 28-30) to work closely with your local crew.

**Commercial:**

We understand that the rental period is over 126 performances. Could you share the dates of the possible extension?

We are excited about the opportunity to support Hell's Kitchen Korea and continue our partnership with S&Co.

Kind Regards,

Greg Gowans (he/him) - Managing Director
